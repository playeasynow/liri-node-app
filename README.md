# Liri | Node App ðŸ¤–
UT Austin Coding Bootcamp | Unit 10 node.js \
v1.0 \
Orig. Deployment - October 21, 2018

# Idea
The challenge was to write a program with node.js --- and no browser! A first for many of us in class. I decided to use inquirer to take in my answer and then based on the answer, I would ask follow up questions.

Here's how it works:

- Open up Terminal / your CLI
- Make sure to download the appropriate npm loaded onto the JSON file
- Type `node liri.js` and hit Enter
- Follow the prompts
- Have fun!

The game uses basic concepts in node packages, modules, and dotenv, so is good for a first run at playing with packages!
